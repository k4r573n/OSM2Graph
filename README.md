#_   OSM to Graph_

This Program provides a routeable graph generated out of 
OpenstreetMap-data. Therefore are highways as well as 
public transportation lines taken into account.

## parsed tagging for public transport

## Future Work
-   In future versions it is planed tu support [this proposal about route segments](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Route_Segments) as well

-   implement as well the Weighted Indoor Routing Graph (WIRG)
    according to:
    Goetz, M.; Zipf, A. Formal definition of a user-adaptive and length-optimal
    routing graph for
    complex indoor environments. Geo-Spat. Inf. Sci. 2011, 14, 119-128.

-   provide a export function to a neo4j database
